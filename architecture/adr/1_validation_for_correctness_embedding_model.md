# ADR: Selection of Embedding Model for Generating Embeddings

## Context
Certifiable, Inc. requires a robust solution for generating embeddings from aptitude test questions and architectural solution case studies. These embeddings will be used for semantic analysis, validation, and ensuring content integrity across certifications.

## Decision
Adopt BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) as the primary embedding model for generating embeddings from textual content. BERT is chosen for its strong performance in capturing semantic nuances of language.

## Rationale
- **Semantic Understanding:** BERT is well-known for its ability to understand context and generate embeddings that capture complex linguistic and semantic relationships.
- **Versatility:** Capable of handling various text formats and lengths, making it suitable for both concise test questions and elaborate case studies.
- **Industry Tested:** BERT is widely used across industries for tasks requiring detailed text comprehension and is supported by numerous libraries and frameworks.

## Trade-Off Analysis

- **BERT (Chosen Model):**
  - **Pros:** Excellent at capturing context and semantics, strong community support, and pre-trained models widely available.
  - **Cons:** Computationally intensive; requires significant resources for processing.
  - **Decision:** Accepted for its robust semantic capabilities and relevance to the use case.

- **Alternative Models (e.g., GPT, RoBERTa):**
  - **Pros:** Similar performance in capturing nuanced semantic details.
  - **Cons:** Often require fine-tuning for optimal performance in specific use cases.
  - **Decision:** Denied in favor of BERT's proven track record and ease of integration.

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - **Enhanced Precision:** Improved accuracy in comparing and validating questions and case studies due to BERT's semantic strengths.
  - **Community Resources:** Leverage existing BERT infrastructure and community resources for smoother implementation and troubleshooting.

- **Negative:**
  - **Resource Demands:** High computational requirements may necessitate infrastructure upgrades or optimization.
  - **Implementation Complexity:** Initial setup of models and embedding pipelines requires detailed planning and execution.
